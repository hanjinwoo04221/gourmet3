     *    bind modifier compares the layer's Root to the (unmirrored) base layer's Root to

     *    Reflecting it makes the delta cross two mirror states -- legs lock into a wrong
     *    rotation in steady-state, and the link transition into walk teleports because the
     *    link's interpolated Root no longer matches the mainhand path. Leaving Root verbatim
     *    means legs compensate identically to mainhand and link blending stays continuous.

     *    offhand-only weapon) needs {@code preserveRoot = false}. There is no follow-up bind

     *    ({@link AimAnimation} / {@link ReboundAnimation}) author a Root yaw that has to flip
