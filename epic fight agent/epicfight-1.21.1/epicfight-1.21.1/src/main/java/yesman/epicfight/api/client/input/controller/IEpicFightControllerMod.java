/// Represents an integration layer for third-party controller mods used by Epic Fight.
///
/// This interface must be implemented by any external controller mod to provide
/// controller input support for Epic Fight.
///
/// It acts as a bridge between the controller mod's input system
/// (e.g., Controlify, Controllable, MidnightControls) and Epic Fight's input handling logic.
///
/// Epic Fight relies on this interface to determine and manage the current [InputMode].
/// Since input mode management is not part of the vanilla
/// Minecraft input system, controller mods must supply their own implementation.
///
/// **Note:** This interface exposes low-level controller integration.
/// Most consumers should use a higher-level abstraction unless direct access is necessary for functionality
/// that cannot be achieved otherwise.
public interface IEpicFightControllerMod {
    /// Returns the controller mod's display name (e.g., `Controlify`).
    /// Intended for logging or debugging only; should not influence gameplay logic or be used as a workaround.
