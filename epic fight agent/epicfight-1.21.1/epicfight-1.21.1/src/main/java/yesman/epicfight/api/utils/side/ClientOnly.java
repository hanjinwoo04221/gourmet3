/// Marked to fields and methods that have danger to crash if they're called
/// in a dedicated server, to avoid a indirect referring to the types that only
/// exist on the client side.
///
/// For example, neoforge marks all client side classes with
/// [net.neoforged.api.distmarker.OnlyIn] annotation, which leads to a crash
/// in a dedicated server when class loader tries to reference client only fields
/// or methods.
///
/// This annotation doesn't have any direct effect in the class load phase. But more
/// to mark the danger fields or methods to ease debugging when invalid dist crash
/// happens.
///
/// This shouldn't necessarily be marked to the fields and methods that belong to
/// classes under `*.client.*` packages since they already ensure the class is only
/// referenced on the client side.
///
/// @see SkillContainer#runOnLocalClient SkillContainer#runOnLocalClient, A common
/// side class but the linked method should be called only in client side since
/// it references [LocalPlayerPatch] in parameters which is a client-side only class.
